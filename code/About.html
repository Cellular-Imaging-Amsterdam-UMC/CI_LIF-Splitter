<h1>About CI LIF Splitter</h1>
<p>
<i>This program can split images from multiple LIF,XLEF or LIF into multiple LIF Files, or can convert 2D or 3D (maximum intensity projection) images to QPTIFF format (Akoya Biosciences®)</i>
</p>
<h2>Selecting Images</h2>
<p>
    Add (multiple) LIF, XLEF or LOF to the tree. Then Select (multiple) nodes to extract. Optionally you can select the preview option from "None" (default) to "Ultra High Quality (slowest)". A small preview is shown with sliders for Tiles, Time and 3D Z-slice sequences. For 3D sequences there is also a max projection toggle button. You can zoom in and out with your mousewheel when hovering over the preview.
</p>
<h2>Operation for Splitting</h2>
<p>
    Click "Split Selection..." to separate the single images to separate LIF Files.
    You can cancel the splitting. It will stop when the current splitting is done.
</p>
<h2>Operation for Converting to QPTIFF</h2>
<p>
    Optionally 2D RGB or or 3D (maximum intensity projection) images can be converted to QPTIFF format.
    QTIFF Files contain both pyramids (downscaled versions of the original data) and a thumbnail.
    QTIFF Files with LZW compression contain the original data without loss or scaling. There is an option to scale 12 bits RGB images (from Leica MICA), to 8 bits to make the more compatible with QuPath.
    QTIFF Files with RGB compression are 8 bits, here there is en option to do Global MinMax scaling for RGB images per channel MinMax for Multichannel images. The JPG Quality can also be changed.
    QTIFF Files can be read by Open-Source Programs: QuPath, AperioImageScope, Omero, Fiji(ImageJ) and more. And Commercial Programs: HALO AI, PathAI and more.
</p>
<p>
    Click "Split Selection..." to separate the single images to separate QTIFF Files.
    Be aware, non supported files (Tiles and Time Series) will be Split to LIF. And 3D images are converted to maximum projection 2D images.

    When an error occurs the GUI can be reset by clicking the R button.
